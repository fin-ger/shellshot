A command-line interface testing extension for jest.

## What is `shellshot`?

The main purpose of `shellshot` is running end2end tests for command-line applications. By providing a speaking API, it is also suited for non-javascript applications and is actually meant to be used for all types of command-line applications.

## Features

 * Run any given command and test for `stdout`, `stderr`, and the `exit code` of the application
 * By integrating into `jest` all of the well known [testing API](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api) can be used with `shellshot`
 * Checking content of files and streams
 * Using [snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) of `jest`

## Getting started

### Install `shellshot` in your current directory

```
$ npm install shellshot
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder containing all dependencies for `shellshot` including `jest`. Make sure to add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore`. The `package-lock.json` file should also be added to your `.gitignore`.

### Creating your first test

To run `jest` tests in your current folder you need to create a `jest` configuration:

```
$ touch jest.config.js
```

You can leave the config empty for now.

Now create a new file `awesome.test.js` with the following content:

```js
const { setup } = require('shellshot');

setup();

it(
    'should run my first shellshot test',
    async () => {
        await expect.command('ls -l')
            .forStdout(expectation => expectation.toContain('jest.config.js'))
            .forExitCode(expectation => expectation.toBe(0));
    },
);
```

Now run lets run your first test:

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/jest
 PASS  ./awesome.test.js
  âœ“ should run my first shellshot test (12ms)
